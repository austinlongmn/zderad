# Zderad

`zderad` is a Python program (naturally) that takes your academic program
directories and puts them into a nicely formatted Microsoft Word document for
Moodle submission.

## Installation

To install, first clone the GitHub Repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/austinlongmn/zderad.git
```

Then, you can install the Python package.

```bash
pip install .
```

If you can't do a global `pip install`, try using `pipx`. You can find
instructions [here](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/installation/).

## Dependencies

This program depends on the external utility `pandoc`. You can find installation
instructions [here](https://pandoc.org/installing.html).
